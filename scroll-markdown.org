#+title: Scrollable code blocks

#+begin_export yaml
output: html_document
#+end_export

This example is translated from from the [[https://github.com/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/blob/master/examples/html-scroll.Rmd][examples/html-scroll.Rmd]] file
of Yihui Xie's Rmarkdown Cookbook to org.

To run this successfully, be sure that the =css= engine is activated.

#+begin_src css :ravel echo=FALSE
  pre {
    max-height: 300px;
    overflow-y: auto;
  }
  pre[class] {
    max-height: 100px;
  }
#+end_src
  

We have defined some CSS rules to limit the height of
code blocks. Now we can test if these rules work on code
blocks and text output:

#+begin_src R
# pretend that we have a lot of code in this chunk
if (1 + 1 == 2) {
  # of course that is true
  print(mtcars)
  # we just printed a lengthy data set
}
#+end_src

  

Next we add rules for a new class `scroll-100` to limit
the height to 100px, and add the class to the output of
a code chunk via the chunk option `class.output`:

#+begin_src css :ravel echo=FALSE
  .scroll-100 {
      max-height: 100px;
      overflow-y: auto;
      background-color: inherit;
  }
#+end_src

#+begin_src R :ravel class.output="scroll-100"
print(mtcars)
#+end_src
